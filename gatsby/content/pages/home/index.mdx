How much of your digital footprint is in the hands of others? How much is
that used to influence you?

Generous Labs is a purpose company that makes ethical software. Software that
supports human rights, democracy, and openness. Software with these values
embedded at every level.

We focus on software that supports peer to peer cooperation. Connect directly
to the people you love. Share, organise and exchange what matters to you.
Without tracking, monitoring, or censorship.

Only when we control our own digital footprints can we be free from external
influence and corporate interests. We believe this has the potential to
radically transform society. This is the future we seek.
